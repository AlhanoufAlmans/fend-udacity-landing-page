# Landing Page Project

Initially srating with HTML/CSS provided by Udacity. Most of the configuration has gone into the JavaScript as it is the primary idea behind this project is to enhance the code creating an interactive navigation bar. 

# Instructions

It is best to not modify the HTML (I have not) but instead populate with JavaScript to best practice your JavaScript to create elemenst and detect which of whom are active.

# That's it!
 
 A project that adds to an unorderred list and takes it to another level with the interactivity by clicking any item at the navbar or scrolling to it
